			<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>Staff Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
			<span class="employer">Sense</span><span class="employerdetails">Modelling electrical power consumption in real-time embedded systems</span><span class="jobdate">2021-present</span><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Led a small team developing and productising causal Mamba models, deployed on low power ARM smart-meters, to distinguish individual devices by their effect on power consumption. Deployed ahead of time and won target contracts with utilities and meter manufacturers.</li>
				<li>Responsible for internationalisation of analysis pipelines and models developed against US-specific data. Sense is now active in Japan, Australia, and the EU.</li>
				<li>Assisted in automation of ground truth gathering and curation. Never stop checking your ground truth. </li>
				<li>Represented the Data Science team in multiple pilots, keeping partners informed and producing reports and analyses required to win large-scale contracts</li> 
				<li>Experimentation on applications of existing in-house transformer and diffusion models, regularly addressing niche tasks with e.g. U-nets, global optimsation by search.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Principal Computational Scientist</h3>
			<span class="employer">Quantum Biosystems Inc.</span><span class="employerdetails">Researching solid-state DNA sensors</span><span class="jobdate">2014-2020</span><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Produced interactive simulations of our technology for presentation to potential investors and collaborators</li>
				<li>Supported engineers and chemists with automated reporting of daily experiments in multiple formats</li>
				<li>Developed flexible pipelines for real-time analysis of experimental data (typically 100s of GB per day)</li>
				<li>Trained robust classifiers - decision forests, CNNs - for use within analysis pipelines, substantially reducing cost of experimenters' time</li>
				<li>Developed and maintained online and offline apps for inspecting and visualising raw data</li>
				<li>Led the informatics team for 3 years</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Senior Computational Scientist</h3>
			<span class="employer">Oxford Nanopore Technologies</span><span class="employerdetails">Bringing novel DNA sequencing technology to market</span><span class="jobdate">2011-2014</span><br>

			<ul>
				<li>Supported biochemists with automated interactive reports on their experimental results</li>
				<li>Developed platform-specific error correction and consensus models for continuous electrical and discrete DNA data</li>
				<li>Produced plots and visualisations for board presentations</li>
				<li>Created an experimental structure to discover novel protein sensing molecules based on an evolutionary algorithm</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Research Associate</h3>
			<span class="employer">Teesside University</span><span class="employerdetails">Research lab using classical AI planning for narrative generation</span><span class="jobdate">2010-2011</span><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Developed agent-based systems for narrative generation, integrating with both internal and international collaborators' front ends</li>
				<li>Prepared manuscripts for publishing at academic conferences and journals</li>
				<li>Designed novel algorithms using AI planning for narrative generation</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Other roles</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Kern Systems - contract data scientist working on a codec for DNA-based data storage</li>
				<li>University of Auckland - tutor for algorithms and data mining courses; lectured introductory computer science</li>
				<li>7am.com - programmer developing and maintaining web crawlers for news aggregation</li>
