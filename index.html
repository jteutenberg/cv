			<div id="summary">
			A data scientist with a broad computer science background. "Full stack" in the sense of experience in the full range of data preparation, processing, modelling and classification, visualisation, and software services. Substantial start-up experience from supporting research, to product development, to software services; but a life-long learner who is always looking to up-skill.

			<h2>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h2>
			
			<h3>Data Exploration</h3>
			<p>
			When initially wrangling data and for explorative programming I use <span class="inskill">Python</span> and <span class="inskill">numpy</span> within a <span class="inskill">Jupyter</span> notebook. For visual exploration I typically use <span class="inskill">matplotlib</span> and <span class="inskill">seaborn</span>.
			</p>
			<span class="skill">Python</span>  <span class="skill">numpy</span> <span class="skill">Jupyter</span> <span class="skill">matplotlib</span> <span class="skill">seaborn</span>
			<p>
			Example: <a href="https://github.com/jteutenberg/speech/blob/main/analysis/analysis.ipynb">[github] notebook preparing pitch mark data for speech models</a>
			</p>

			<h3>Visualisation and Reporting</h3>
			<p>
			I prefer online <span class="inskill">Javascript</span>-based interactive reports with figures based on <span class="inskill">d3.js</span>. I have also used PixiJS for higher performance rendering. For regular, automated reports I set up <span class="inskill">REST</span>ful services for polling data as small python servers.
			</p>

			<p>
			Example: <a href="https://github.com/jteutenberg/figurative">[github] Consistant, reusable interactive reports using d3.js</a>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Modelling and Classification</h3>
			<p>
			I use <span class="inskill">scipy</span> for simple statistical models and <span class="inskill">sk-learn</span> for machine learning.
			</p>
			<p> When deep learning makes sense I prefer <span class="inskill">pytorch</span> using the <span class="inskill">fastai</span> training loop.
			</p>
			<span class="skill">scipy</span> <span class="skill">sk-learn</span> <span class="skill">pytorch</span> <span class="skill">fastai</span>

			<h3>Analysis Pipelines</h3>
			<p>
			For high-throughput pipelines I prefer <span class="inskill">golang</span>, though I also work with <span class="inskill">C++</span> and <span class="inskill">C</span>. Versioned analysis results are stored in standard SQL databases.
			</p>
			<span class="skill">golang</span> <span class="skill">C++</span> <span class="skill">C</span> <span class="skill">SQL</span>
			<p>
			Example: <a href="https://github.com/jteutenberg/pipe-cleaner">[github] Pipe-cleaner: a small framework for streaming pipelines in golang</a>
